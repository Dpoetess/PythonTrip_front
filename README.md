## 📄 Project Description

**Python Tryp** Pyton Tryp is a mobile travel recommendation application that allows users to select itineraries based on suggestions provided by the app and to generate personalised itineraries. Users will be able to create and manage collections of
their favourite places, view: 

## 🎯 Motivation

Our motivation is to offer a clean and accessible design for the user with the possibility to interact intuitively with the application.

## 🚀 Features

### Python Tryp Users (CRUD Operations)
- **Create**: Register new users in the application
- **Read**: Search and browse itineraries by different criteria
- **Update**: Updates information on itineraries and destinations
- **Delete**: Remove user information
- **Validation**: Ensure there are no duplicates in the itineraries by using appropriate validations. 

### User Preferences (CRUD Operations)
- **Create**: Register preferences of destinations, locations, etc.
- **Read**: View their stored preferences in a profile or settings page.
- **Update**: Enable users to modify their existing trip preferences.
- **Delete**:Allow users to remove specific preferences or reset all preferences.
- **Validation**: Ensure there are no duplicates 

### User Management (CRUD Operations)
- **Create**: Register new users in the application.
- **Read**: The system may use these preferences to suggest itineraries and locations 
- **Update**: The system updates the user's data.
- **Delete**: Remove users from the system.
- **Validation**: Ensure no duplicate users using appropriate validations.

## 📅 Project Management
This project was developed by a team of 6 developers using SCRUM. Tools like Jira were used for backlog management and sprint planning.


## 📖 Documentation
- **[Algorithm Flowchart](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mAbBGxqN5jEWShzmNyD6wV6rYGYuTjZA/view   )**: A flowchart illustrating the main algorithms implemented in the project
- **[Data Model](https://drawsql.app/teams/lp-11/diagrams/pythontrip)**: A diagram showing the key entities of the system and their relationships, available on DrawSQL.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python (v3.12.4)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (v16.2)
- **Testing**: Pytest (v8.3.2), Unittest (integrated with Python)
- **Version Control**: Git (v2.45.2) with GitFlow
- **Agile Methodologies**: SCRUM
- **Visual Studio Code**
- **React**
- **Django**
- **Figma**


## 📦 Installation and Configuration

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   https://github.com/helopgom/PythonTrip_front.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. **Configure the database:**
 Create a database in PostgreSQL.

    Configure the .env file with the database credentials.


## 🧪 Testing

- **Run unit and integration tests:**

    ```bash
    Jest
    ```
### Types of Tests Performed
- **Unit Tests**: Verify the functionality of individual components, ensuring that each function and method works as intended.
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure that different modules and components work together seamlessly.

### Code Coverage
- The test suite has achieved a **code coverage of over 80%**, meeting the project requirements.
- This level of coverage ensures that the majority of the codebase is well-tested, reducing the risk of bugs and ensuring the reliability of core functionalities.
- To check the code coverage yourself, follow these steps:
  - Install the coverage package if you haven't already:
    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev jest
    ```
  - Run the tests with coverage:
    ```bash
    npm run test:coverage
        ```
  - Generate a coverage report:
    ```bash
    npx jest --coverage
    ```
- The coverage report will provide detailed insights into which parts of the codebase are covered by tests and which parts might need additional testing.
